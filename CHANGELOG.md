### Added

- New in-game configuration options have been added to allow the individual adjustment of
  music and sound volumes.

  added as a menu option. The Desktop version of the game will persist the desired display
  mode and start windowed or in fullscreen mode according to the settings you made.

- The Desktop app of the game has gained support for Steam overlays. Prior to this release,
  it was not possible to use Steam's key combination (usually Shift+Tab)to toggle the Steam
  overlay. This should now be possible.

- Gamepad types can be automatically detected. It is still possible to overwrite the
  gamepad button styles to be shown in help tooltips in the "controls" screen, though.

- Full support for Google Stadia game pads has been added.
  All overlays have been adjusted to show tooltips that match the button layout of Stadia
  game pads, if a Stadia game pad has been detected or manually selected.

### Added

- Two new command line flags have been added to the Desktop version of the game:
  `--dev` can be used to enable the Chromium Developer Tools upon startup and
  `--no-fullscreen` can be used to open the game in a window instead of switching
  to fullscreen mode immediately.
- Global state that keeps track of achieved endings (via localStorage)
- Little ending icons that appear in the main menu after finishing the game once to
  visualize which endings have been achieved and how many there are.

  ending song (with male vocals)
